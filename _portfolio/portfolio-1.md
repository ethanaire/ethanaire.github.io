In this project, I implemented three different Regression models (Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Bagging Regressor) to produce Airbnb pricing forecasts based on selected features from the original dataset. Specifically, Initial Data Analysis as well as Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering are conducted to prepare all important Airbnb features before running and tuning the models' parameters to have the best outcomes. 

The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ethanaire/Sydney-Airbnb-prices-prediction/tree/main).
